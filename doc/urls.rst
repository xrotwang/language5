URL Conventions
================

Index Pages
-----------

Index pages have a trailing slash as they are a *command*:

* /language/
* /family/

All requests to the non-canonical form without a trailing slash should be 
redirected to the canonical form.

* /language -> /language/
* /family -> /family/


Detail pages
------------

Do not have a trailing slash as they are a parameter. e.g.

* /language/maori
* /family/austronesian
