            {{ SITE_NAME }} is a database of the Trans-New Guinea language family and
            friends. The Trans-New Guinea language family currently occupies most of 
            the interior of New Guinea. This family is possibly the third largest in 
            the world with 400 languages and is tentatively thought to have originated 
            with root-crop agriculture around 10,000 years ago. However, vanishingly little 
            is known about this familyâ€™s history. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This project aims to reveal the prehistory of New Guinea using the
            linguistic comparative method combined with novel
            computational phylogenetic methods.
